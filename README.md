## Introduction
Bellabeat is a successful small high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women since 2013. 
The co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen is confident that an analysis of non-Bellebeat consumer data (ie. FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for growth.

In order to answer the key business objectives I will be following the six steps of the data analysis process: <b>
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyse
5. Share
6. Act
</b>

# 1. Ask
## Business Objective:
Identify & unlock new growth opportunities with data analysis by:

- Analyse smart device usage data
- Gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices
- Identify how Bellabeat can use these insights to modify its marketing strategy.


#### Key Stakeholders
- Urška Sršen (cofounder and Chief Creative Officer)
- Sando Mur (cofounder and Bellabeat executive team member)
- Bellabeat marketing analytics team

# 2. Prepare
## 2.1 Data Source
- The dataset used for this analysis: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit).
- CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic).
- Sameple size of 30 Fitbit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
- Dataset collected and generated by respondents to a distrubted survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk Between 3/12/2016 - 5/12/2016.

## 2.2 Is the Data good or bad?
A good data source should "ROCCC":
- <b>R</b>eliable
- <b>O</b>riginal
- <b>C</b>omprehensive
- <b>C</b>urrent
- <b>C</b>ited 

After looking at the data, I will assign ratings of LOW, MEDIUM & HIGH to the following ROCCC acronym to determine the creditbilty of the data set being used.
1. Reliable: LOW - Data collected from only 30 partipants which means that the dataset is quite small and will not show an accurate respresentation of the true population.
2. Orignal: LOW - The data was collected by Amazon Mechanical Turk which is a third party entity. With limited information given on how these surveys were conducted & collected, there is no guarantee that these surveys were done at random. Therefore this could lead to potentially bias data,
3. Comprehensive: LOW - The data does not include any qualitative data or additional information about the users.
4. Current: LOW - Dataset is 5 years old and was collected between 3/12/2016 - 5/12/2016.
5. Cited: LOW - Data is collected by a third party platform

The dataset provided is not comprehensive enough to provide a full detailed analysis into all of Bellabeats products. After further examination of the all the datasets provided many of the datasets provided are either redundant, have no relevance in answering the business objective & lack the sufficent data to perform the analysis required.
I have decided to use the dailyActivity_merged.csv to analysis the business objective as this was the only dataset that had releveant information needed.

## 2.3 Data Selection
The following data file is being used for the analysis:
- dailyActivity_merged.csv

# 3. Process
